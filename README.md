# LINQ In-Depth Part 1

This sample is the accompanying code for [LINQ In-Depth Part 1](http://understandingsoftware.co.uk/programming/linq-in-depth-part1/). 
<br>
<br>
There is a method for each of the three features in the article, and there are multiple queries for each using both fluent and query syntax which can be run by uncommenting the relevant code blocks.
<br>
<br>
See the tutorial for full details on the code for this sample.

## Build and run

To build and run the sample, execute the following command:

```console
dotnet run
```

`dotnet restore` restores the dependencies of the sample. `dotnet run` builds the sample and runs the output executable. It implicitly runs `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies of the sample. If you're using .NET Core 1.0 or .NET Core 1.1 instead of .NET Core 2.0 or a later version, you have to run `dotnet restore` yourself.
